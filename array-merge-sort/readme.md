## Merge and order arrays
Java program that takes arrays of strings, merges them into one array, and orders elements in alphabetical order using bubble sort

### My code
[array-merge-sort.java](/c/array-merge-sort/array-merge-sort.java)

### Instructions
As the COMP 202 instructors, we need your help. Each instructor has an alphabetically ordered list
of the students in their section. However, we would like to get one ordered list that contains all the
students in all sections. Complete the Java program given in Question2.java to help us out. In this
ﬁle, you’ll ﬁnd 3 lists of students, where each list is represented by an array. Follow the instructions
in the Java ﬁle to merge these arrays. For example, if {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"} is one array,
and {"Adam", "Chloe", "David"} is another array, the merged array should be {"Adam", "Alice",
"Bob", "Charlie", "Chloe", "David"}. As you are writing your program, you may want to visit the
Java API at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/, and see if any of the String methods can
be helpful. However, you are not allowed to use any library methods related to arrays.
